Data Source:
The monster data was created with a toolkit called Fortuna.
Not only did I build the dataset, I also built all the tools used to build the dataset.

- [MonsterFactory | Monster Generator](https://pypi.org/project/MonsterFactory/)
- [Fortuna | Python RNG Toolkit](https://pypi.org/project/Fortuna/)
- [Storm | C++ RNG Engine](https://github.com/BrokenShell/Storm)
